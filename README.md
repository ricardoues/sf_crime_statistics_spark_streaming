# San Francisco Crime Statistics with Spark Streaming 

## Project Overview 

In this project, you will be provided with a real-world dataset, extracted from Kaggle, on San Francisco crime incidents, and you will provide statistical analyses of the data using Apache Spark Structured Streaming. You will draw on the skills and knowledge you've learned in this course to create a Kafka server to produce data, and ingest data through Spark Structured Streaming.

You can try to answer the following questions with the dataset:

* What are the top types of crimes in San Fransisco?
* What is the crime density by location?
